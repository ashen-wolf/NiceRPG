# NiceRPG
Nice RPG is going to be an RPG game similar to Final Fantasy or Pokemon.

It is 

The current model has graphics, but no animation. It has a working combat system, but it needs improvement and balancing. 
There is not currently any sound, and the only difference between levels is visual. 
There is no starting screen, and not much of a closing one either.


This project was written in 2019 by Ash Thom, and all visual resources were sourced from Reddit (Thanks Wilson)
Special Thanks to Wilson Doxtator who let me look around in his code for scraps for me to use, 
Sage Triffo who helped me with Character concepts, and most of all, Thanks to McCafe for making this whole project possible.
