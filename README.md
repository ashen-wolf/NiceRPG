# NiceRPG
Nice RPG is going to be an RPG game similar to Final Fantasy or Pokemon.
Ash Thom

It is a fight between two birds in the sky. It is controlled through the a s d and q keys.

The current model has graphics, but no animation. It has a working combat system, but it needs improvement and balancing. 
There is not currently any sound, and the only difference between levels is visual. 
There is no starting screen, and not much of a closing one either.

There is no world to explore currently, and to be honest the gameplay is a little boring. 
There are no real animations or sounds. also the enemy heals way too much.

First, The concept of the project was conceived. I wanted to make a final Fantasy-esque rpg in which there was turn based combat.
Time passed, and I found it was the night before the beta testing and I had done almost nothing. I drank a bunch of coffee and got coding.
By the next day I had a text-based turn-based functional product that I was pretty proud of. 
The game worked pretty well and Didn't have any bugs I could find.
Time passed and it was a week before the Final due date. I had changed almost nothing(I had made sme atttempts at graphics, all of which went poorly)
I wrote and integrated the code throughout the week, spending my entire day on it the day before it was due. 
It worked pretty well, with a couple of bugs i fixed in class.
The order of operations from here is the following:
Add animation to fighting
Add variation to second level
Improve combat system
Add starting screen
Add sound
Add Level to travel through and explore
Add additional characters

This project was written in 2019 by Ash Thom, and all visual resources were sourced from Reddit (Thanks Wilson)
